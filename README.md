#Blue Gold: Predicting Water Accessibility in Natural Waterbodies

Water, often referred to as "blue gold," is vital for ecosystems, communities, and industry. This project offers data-driven solutions to assess and forecast water availability in various natural waterbodies. It applies statistical and machine learning models tailored to the unique behavior of each waterbody (lakes, rivers, springs, etc.), factoring in elements like climate, geography, and seasonal variability. Our approach lies at the intersection of ecological stewardship and data science, offering precise predictions to aid water resource management.
